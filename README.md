# FoxDefenseContracts

Fox Defense Contracts is both in itself a modÂ and an Expansion of BDArmory Continued Runway Project. The mod at its current state is packed with many turrets from many nations. It in itself also has some armor panels that can help make more detailed tanks. 

If there's any suggestions. Best to use the feature requests tab in github here and I'll check it sometime. 

Current update is 2.2 - Legacy Hardware Updates
