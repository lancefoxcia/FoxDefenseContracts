# FoxDefenseContracts

Fox Defense Contracts is both in itself a mod and an Expansion of BDArmory Continued. The main goal is to add in much more tank turrets for both the ksp war communities and the creative community.

This WIP is soon to have a full official release with a lot of changes coming soon. Mainly QOL and other changes that will bring a bit of freshness to the mod. (I think.) 

I would love to hear suggestions about what to add in and what to change.
