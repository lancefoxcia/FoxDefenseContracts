description = During the war in Africa, the Italians found that their medium and light tanks had a lack of armour and insufficient firepower against the Allied tanks. At the beginning of 1940, they began work on a project for a heavy infantry support tank, which was to fight alongside the medium tanks. The project was initially designated as the P75 for its 75/18 mm cannon, which was later changed to a longer 75/32 gun and finally a 75/34 cannon with better anti-tank capabilities.
