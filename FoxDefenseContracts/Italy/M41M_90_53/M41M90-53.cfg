description = The Semovente da 90/53 was a self propelled gun mainly made to provide support infantry and take out light and medium tanks that were used by the allies. It's main armament was mounted on the rear of a lengthened M14/41 hull and chassis. The 90 mm 90/53 mod.41 was made by modifying an anti-air cannon. It would have its first combat debut during the allied landings in Sicily where it proved itself, however due to the sheer allied power both in the air and ground, the little numbers produced of this platform wouldn't be enough for Italy to defend itself.
