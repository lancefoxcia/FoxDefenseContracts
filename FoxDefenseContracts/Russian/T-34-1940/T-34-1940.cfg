description = The T-34 (1940) is the first variant of the T-34 medium tank family. The T-34 medium tank family was and continues to be legendary. It is not only one of the most produced tank types of World War II, with 84,000 units produced of all variants (compared to 48,966 M4 Sherman units produced of all variants), but it is also one of the longest-serving tanks ever created. Many are still stored as reserves in bases in Asia and Africa, and others saw active service in the 1990s (the 1991-1999 Yugoslav war).
