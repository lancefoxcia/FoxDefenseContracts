description = The T-34-57 (nickname: exterminator) is a fourth and early experimental variant of the T-34 medium tank family. The Soviet Army was looking for new and upgraded guns to be mounted on its latest tanks as early as 1940. On May 19, 1941, testing of the new 57 mm Zavod imeni Stalina (ZiS) 4 tank gun began. V.G. Grabin designed this gun, which was based on the 57 mm ZiS-2 gun. It was capable of firing a 3.14 kg warhead and could pierce 70 mm (2.76 in) of armour at a 30-degree angle at a range of 1000 m (1100 yd).
