description = The ZSU-37-2 entered development at the same time as the ZSU-23-4, in April 1957. These two SPAA were to fill two separate requirements, the ZSU-23-4 was to combat targets at 1.5km, and the ZSU-37-2 was to combat targets at a height of 3.0km. Trials were underway in December 1960, and both vehicles were deemed acceptable for service. In September 1962 however, the ZSU-23-4 was chosen for both roles, effectively cancelling the planned mass production of the ZSU-37-2.
