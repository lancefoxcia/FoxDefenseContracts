description = The Object 268 self-propelled gun was one of the many derivative designs of the T-10 heavy tank. The concept began on 2 July 1952 at the Leningrad Kirov Plant on the order of the Council of Ministers USSR. The Object 268 would follow in the same line of doctrine as had the earlier Soviet self-propelled guns of World War II, the SU-100, -122, and -152. This contrasted with the Western concept of a self-propelled gun being used as an artillery piece rather than the Soviet usage as a tank destroyer. There had been earlier attempts at converting a heavy tank to a self-propelled gun, using the chassis of the IS-4 and IS-7, but those had not been fully developed and were cancelled. The IS-4 production was running too slowly and the IS-7 had been too complex to manufacture in large numbers. The Leningrad Kirov Plant worked to produce an SPG on the T-10 chassis by combining it with the 152 mm M-48 cannon, which had high velocity and was much more powerful than earlier 152 mm cannons. Drawing work led to the Object 730 SPG which would be paired with the M-53 cannon, a parallel development to the M-48.
