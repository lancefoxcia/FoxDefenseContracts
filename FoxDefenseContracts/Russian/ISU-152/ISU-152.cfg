description = The ISU-152 (Russian: Самоходная установка на базе танка ИС с орудием калибра 152мм, ИСУ-152, romanized: Samokhodnaya Ustanovka na baze tanka IS s orudiyem kalibra 152mm, meaning "IS tank based self-propelled installation with 152mm caliber gun") is a Soviet self-propelled gun developed and used during World War II. It was unofficially nicknamed Zveroboy (Russian: Зверобой; "beast killer") in response to several large German tanks and guns coming into service, including Tigers and Panthers. Since the ISU-152's gun was mounted in a casemate, aiming it was awkward, and had to be done by repositioning the entire vehicle using the tracks. Therefore, it was used as mobile artillery to support more mobile infantry and armor attacks. It continued service into the 1970s and was used in several campaigns and countries.
