description = The success of the PT-76 amphibious tank prompted the development of a successor with improved characteristics on the battlefield. The PT-76 chassis was taken up by the Stalingrad Tractor Factory in 1962 to be improved. The vehicle was given the project name Object 906. Two were produced and tested between 1962-1963, each armed with an 85 mm cannon and also implemented the newer technology such as gun stabilization, auto-loader, and a welded aluminium armour for weight-saving. The design proved reliable with a 300 hp engine and could reach a top speed of 75 km/h. Had it been adopted, the Object 906 would've been given the name PT-85, but the vehicle design never left the prototype stages and consequently never adopted. A single prototype still exists in Kubinka Tank Museum.
