description = The Chi-Ha LG / Long 12 cm SPG (長十二糎自走砲) was an obscure, one-off prototype discovered by US Marines at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, with little information available on its development. It was created by the 1st Section of the Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Department and assembled at Yokosuka. The vehicle was essentially a stripped-down Chi-Ha hull, modified with a metal platform extension to accommodate the gun crew, and fitted with a surplus 12 cm/45 10th Year Cannon, typically used on cruisers, carriers, or as coastal batteries.
