description = The Experimental Anti-Air Ta-Se was a prototype anti-air vehicle to mechanize the Type 98 20 mm cannon for armoured companies. Early during the design phase, the easy-to-produce Type 94 anti-air truck was developed and took away the priority of further developing the Ta-Se. The Ta-Se was supposed to supplement the Type 98 Ke-Ni and replace the Type 95 Ha-Go; however, it was not formally adopted. In the end, the Army decided it was easier to maintain Type 98 cannons towed behind trucks or use the Type 94 truck as a flatbed than having to adopt and mass produce anti-air tanks to move the same anti-air guns.
