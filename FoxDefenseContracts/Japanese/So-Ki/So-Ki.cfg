description = The Experimental Anti-Air So-Ki was a further development of anti-air mechanization for Japan as the idea for it wasn't completely abandoned. While the previous Ta-Se wasn't adopted into service due to lower accuracy, crew comfort, and in turn, difficulty maintaining a high fire rate, the So-Ki would go a step further to fix these issues. The Ke-Ni was once again chosen as a chassis and instead of an enclosed turret with a singular gun, the So-Ki design was opted to carry 2 x Type 2 20 mm cannons packing more volume of fire and only offering a gunshield to decrease the weight of the gun traverse and less cramping of the gunner.
