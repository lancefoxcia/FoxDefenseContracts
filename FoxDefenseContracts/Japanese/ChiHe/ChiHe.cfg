description = The Chi-He was a tank designed to streamline the design of the Chi-Ha Kai and improve on armour and engine power. While the streamlining of the design featured welded armour instead of riveted armour, a 5th crew member and slightly more armour, the final design only weighed 1.5 tons more than the Chi-Ha Kai. Production only caught on in 1943 due to the Navy's priority in raw materials and all Chi-He's were reserved for the defence of the Home Islands. While the Chi-He did improve on the Chi-Ha Kai, it didn't improve enough to compete with the likes of a M4 Sherman, and served its hull to build the Type 3 Chi-Nu.
