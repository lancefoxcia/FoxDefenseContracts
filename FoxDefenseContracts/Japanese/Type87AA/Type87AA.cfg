description = The Type 87 Self-propelled Anti-aircraft Gun (87式自走高射機関砲, 87-shiki jisō kōsha kikanhō) is a Japanese air defense weapon built around the Oerlikon 35 mm twin cannon system as used on the Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. The system uses a modified Type 74 tank chassis. It is also nicknamed by field officers as "Guntank" after the similar-looking mecha in the Mobile Suit Gundam series.
