description = As the French Army's vast fleet of Renault FT tanks passed into obsolescence after WWI, some efforts were made to upgrade the vehicles. One proposal was to convert them into tank destroyers, but the plan was never implemented. The Renault FT AC excels at the stationary tank destroyer role. It offers an interesting selection of guns that can make short work of anything it comes across.
