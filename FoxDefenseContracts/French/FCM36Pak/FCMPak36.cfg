description = The FCM 36 or Char léger Modèle 1936 FCM, was a light infantry tank that was designed for the French Army prior to World War II. It had a crew of two and was equipped with a short 37 mm main armament and a 7.5 mm coaxial machine gun. Power was provided by a diesel engine. The Germans captured 37 FCM 36s, using the administrative designation Panzerkampfwagen 737 FCM (f) for them. In 1943, ten of the captured FCMs were rebuilt as Marder I tank destroyers, which were employed by the 21st Panzer Division in the Battle of Normandy in 1944. Besides FCM 36, the Germans also used other captured French vehicles for the Marder I conversion; Lorraine 37L (170 produced), Hotckiss H35 (unknown number produced) and Hotckiss H39 (24 produced).
