description = The AMX-30 DCA is a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the chassis of the AMX-30 main battle tank. In particular the AMX-30SA chassis with modifications for use in desert climate was used, since the only production vehicles were destined for Saudi Arabia. The large round turret in conjunction with the AMX-30 chassis make the AMX-30 DCA easy to identify. There are no variants, except for its predecessor. The AMX-13 DCA is described in a separate article.
