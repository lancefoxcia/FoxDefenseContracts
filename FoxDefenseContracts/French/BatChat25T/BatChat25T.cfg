description = The Batignolles-Chatillon Char 25T was a French medium tank developed by Batignolles-Chatillon in the 1950s. It was designed for a 25-ton weight class, which is twice the weight of the AMX-13. Its primary armament was a 90mm cannon, and was operated by 4 crew members. Its speed could reach 65 km/h. Two prototypes were made before it was set aside. However, some principles of creation of the tank and some of its technology was used in other French AFVs. Some variants were developed, but none of these were ever used in active service with the French Army.
