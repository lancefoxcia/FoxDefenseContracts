description = Various studies were carried out in the 1950s to equip the French Army with DCA self-propelled vehicles. The chassis of the AMX 13 and the EBR were used to produce prototypes equipped with a turret containing a 40 mm Bofors L cannon. / 70. The study of the SAMM S 980 turret being abandoned in 1957, the production of the 40 L / 70 gun in 1958, the self-propelled project stopped there. In fact the first and only armored DCA cannons of French manufacture produced for France only appeared in 1966, still on an AMX 13 chassis but with a 30mm twin-tube turret SAMM S401.
