description = The char 2C, also known as the FCM 2C, was a French post WWI heavy tank landship, later considered a super-heavy tank.[1][page needed] It was developed during World War I but not deployed until after the war. It was, in total volume or physical dimensions, the largest operational tank ever made. Ten tanks were built in 1921. Although remaining operational, their value at the start of World War II was largely propagandistic. After Germany broke through French defences in June 1940, they were sent away from the front to preserve them. They were unable to reach safety and deliberately destroyed to prevent capture.
