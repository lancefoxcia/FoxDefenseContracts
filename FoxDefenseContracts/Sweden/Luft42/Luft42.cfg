description = Luftvärnsfordon are often based on shatterproof or armored chassis which have been equipped with air defense weapons in open shafts or in cannon towers. This creates a mobile and protected platform for air defense warfare. The chassis is often based on an existing chassis from a tank or similar, but there are also several examples where the chassis is designed from the ground up for use as an air defense vehicle.
