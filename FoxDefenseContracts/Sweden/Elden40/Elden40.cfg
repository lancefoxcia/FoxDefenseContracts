description = In the continued material planning work presented Study Group 3 (the group for air defense studies at the army staff) at the end of January 1958 a compilation of characteristics of various belt air defense projects. Here, the following five different alternatives were compared. In "Victoria" with new 57 mm cannon II "1st two-car alternative" with new 57 mm cannon III "Light conventional wagon" new construction) with 40 mm w / 48 cannon IV "2nd two-car alternative" - ​​Lvkv 42 with 40 mm w / 48 cannon + Lvev V "Completed Grantham" with 2 pcs 30 mm Hispano cannons After another year of studies finally took KATF in mid-April 1959 a decision in principle on the acquisition of a "Grantham wagon" (a foreign anti-tank anti-aircraft alternative that has been studied for some time) - despite the disadvantages of a new caliber and new ammunition was significant. These disadvantages were, however, judged to be outweighed that wagons as well as weapons and ammunition were expected to become German standard. However, the decision was controversial in that respect that it was not a Swedish-developed carriage and a month later was appointed.
