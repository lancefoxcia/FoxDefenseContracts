description = The Pansarvärnskanonvagn m/43 (Pvkv m/43) was a tank destroyer developed by Landsverk. As the use of tanks became more and more important during the Second World War, fighting them became more and more urgent. The German Wehrmacht had success with StuG III and StuG IV in this area. Therefore, the Swedish Army decided to emulate the StuG III and StuG IV examples and create a similar vehicle.
