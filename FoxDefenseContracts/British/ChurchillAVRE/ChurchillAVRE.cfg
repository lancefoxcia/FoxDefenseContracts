description = The Churchill AVRE Petard, officially the "Mortar, Recoiling, Spigot, 29 mm, Mk I", was the first vehicle to bear the name "AVRE" (Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineer) as a breakthrough tank for the British Army's Royal Engineers. The 1942 Dieppe Raid revealed a dire need for a vehicle that could assist in breaching extensive bunker/pillbox defences, particularly when attempting to break through enemy lines from new beachheads. This vehicle would serve as a mobile cover for Royal Engineers while operating in the battlefield. After evaluations of several tanks, the Churchill infantry tank became the chosen vehicle for this mission. Aside from some components being replaced by engineering supplies and having larger side doors for infantry operation, a new 29 mm spigot mortar, dubbed the "flying dustbin", was also installed in the turret to launch ranged demolition charges without having to leave the vehicle during crossfire. After trials in 1943, the new vehicle, now known as the Churchill AVRE, was ready for service and proved very successful during the breakthrough stage in the Normandy Landings in June 1944. The 79th Armoured Division, with their "Hobart's Funnies" vehicles, successfully provided reliable support for the first wave of assault groups. The AVRE name would also be retained for all new vehicles designed for these purposes, including the Centurion Mk.5 AVRE which was still in service during the Gulf War of the 1990s.
