description = The Hummel (Sd.Kfz. 165) was a self-propelled artillery piece used by Germany in WWII. It was armed with the powerful 15 cm sFH 18/1 L/30 howitzer, capable of indirect fire support and devastating high-explosive bombardment. While lightly armored and slow to aim, it packed a heavy punch.
