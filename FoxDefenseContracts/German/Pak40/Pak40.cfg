description = The 7.5 cm Pak 40 (7,5 cm Panzerabwehrkanone 40 - lit. "7.5cm armour defence cannon 40") was a German 75 millimetre anti-tank gun developed in 1939–1941 by Rheinmetall and used during the Second World War. With 23,303 examples produced, the Pak 40 formed the backbone of German anti-tank guns for the later part of World War II, mostly in towed form, but also on a number of tank destroyers such as the Marder series.
