description = The Waffenträger 88 mm PaK 43/3 is a German prototype tank destroyer from World War II. With its default yellow camouflage, low profile, and 88 mm cannon, the Waffenträger is a versatile tank destroyer that can play many roles and offer new playstyles that are not possible with conventional turretless German tank destroyers. The vehicle had a single 88 mm PaK43/3 gun and no secondary armament. It was assumed from the start that the new tank destroyer would be as simple in construction and design as possible, that the crew compartment would only be marginally protected, and that the vehicle would enter production as soon as possible.
